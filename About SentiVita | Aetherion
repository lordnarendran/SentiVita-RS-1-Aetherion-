SentiVita's Aetherion (VZ, Alpha 1 Billion) – Final Year Project Highlights
Custom Medical LLM: Fine-tuned LLaMA 3.2 1B on 22M+ instruction-response medical QA pairs (~5.7B tokens) across 19+ datasets, including PubMed QA, MedMCQA, and MedConcepts QA.

Facial Authentication: Integrated DeepFace-based secure login for distinct roles—doctor, patient, pharmacist, and receptionist.

Multi-role Interface: Built with JavaScript , offering customized functionalities and a futuristic UI for each user role.

Disease Prediction System: Leverages the ResNet50 architecture to predict different diseases through a slider.

Language Support: Accessible in 7 languages, improving usability across diverse patient demographics.

Cognitive & Therapeutic Modules: Includes ASMR therapy (5 sound themes), mental health games, and self-healing tools for patient well-being.

Live Medical Feed: Displays real-time medical news, emergency updates, and healthcare alerts within the system.

Advanced Visualizations: Uses 14 ResNet-trained datasets to deliver 6+ medical imaging tools, including:

Edge Detection

Histogram Equalization

Gradient Magnitude
